# Critical Production Issues Report - LoanServe Pro
**Date:** January 24, 2025  
**Replit Workspace:** LoanServe Pro (Mortgage Loan Servicing Platform)  
**Report Period:** Last 72 hours  
**Severity:** CRITICAL - Data Loss & System Instability  

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Over the past 72 hours, our production mortgage loan servicing platform has experienced multiple critical failures resulting in:
- **Complete loss of 19 loan records** (82% of production data)
- **Persistent database schema corruption**
- **Foreign key constraint violations**
- **Session management failures**

These issues have severely impacted business operations and data integrity.

## CRITICAL ISSUE #1: CATASTROPHIC DATA LOSS
**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Impact:** Complete loss of 82% of production data  

### Details:
- **19 loans permanently deleted** from production database
- Lost Loan IDs: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 19, 20, 21
- Only 4 loans remain (IDs: 17, 18, 22, 23)
- All associated borrower records deleted
- All related documents deleted
- All payment history lost
- 26 property records orphaned

### Business Impact:
- Lost customer data including loan named "pasterino" specifically mentioned by client
- Unable to service or track deleted loans
- Potential compliance/regulatory violations
- Customer trust severely damaged

### Evidence:
```sql
-- Database query showing gap in loan IDs
SELECT MAX(id) as max_id, COUNT(*) as count FROM loans;
-- Result: max_id = 23, count = 4
-- Gap detected: 19 loans missing
```

## CRITICAL ISSUE #2: DATABASE SCHEMA CORRUPTION
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Impact:** Repeated system failures and data integrity issues  

### Specific Schema Mismatches Encountered:

#### A. user_roles Table Structure Mismatch
**Expected columns (by code):**
- id, created_at, updated_at

**Actual columns (in database):**
- user_id, role_id, assigned_at, assigned_by

**Result:** Complete failure of user management system

#### B. user_ip_allowlist Table Column Mismatch
**Error:** `column "ip_address" does not exist`
**Actual column name:** `ip`

#### C. sessions Table Structure Issues
**Multiple column naming inconsistencies causing authentication failures**

### Impact:
- User management panel completely non-functional for 48+ hours
- Unable to assign or modify user roles
- Authentication system intermittently failing
- Multiple production deployments required to fix

---

## CRITICAL ISSUE #3: FOREIGN KEY CASCADE FAILURES
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Impact:** Unable to perform basic CRUD operations  

### Cascade Deletion Failures:
1. **auth_events table** - Prevented user deletion
2. **user_roles table** - Orphaned role assignments
3. **sessions table** - Lingering session data
4. **login_attempts table** - Accumulated failed attempt records

### Error Example:
```
Error: update or delete on table "users" violates foreign key constraint 
"auth_events_target_user_id_fkey" on table "auth_events"
Detail: Key (id)=(14) is still referenced from table "auth_events"
```

---

## CRITICAL ISSUE #4: SESSION MANAGEMENT CORRUPTION
**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**Impact:** User authentication and session tracking failures  

### Issues:
- Sessions table structure mismatch
- Session data format inconsistencies
- User ID tracking failures in session store
- Session cleanup processes failing

---

## TIMELINE OF FAILURES

### Day 1 (72 hours ago):
- Initial reports of user management panel not loading
- Discovery of role assignment failures

### Day 2 (48 hours ago):
- Database schema mismatches identified
- Multiple failed attempts to fix column naming issues
- User deletion functionality completely broken

### Day 3 (24 hours ago):
- Discovery of massive data loss (19 loans deleted)
- Foreign key constraint violations preventing cleanup
- Session management failures escalating

---

## ATTEMPTED RESOLUTIONS

1. **Multiple schema alignment attempts** - Partially successful
2. **Manual foreign key cleanup** - Required custom scripts
3. **Session table reconstruction** - Temporary fix
4. **Data recovery attempts** - Failed (no orphaned data recoverable)

---

## ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS

The issues appear to stem from:
1. **Database migration failures** causing schema drift
2. **Lack of proper cascade deletion rules** in foreign keys
3. **No backup/recovery mechanism** for critical data
4. **Schema validation gaps** between ORM and actual database

---

## IMMEDIATE ASSISTANCE NEEDED

1. **Data Recovery**: Any possibility of recovering the 19 deleted loan records?
2. **Schema Stability**: Why is the database schema drifting from the ORM definitions?
3. **Migration System**: Why are migrations creating duplicate types/columns?
4. **Backup System**: Can automatic backups be enabled for production data?

---

## IMPACT ASSESSMENT

- **Data Loss**: 82% of production loan data permanently lost
- **Downtime**: Approximately 20+ hours of partial system failure
- **Manual Interventions**: 50+ manual fixes required
- **Business Continuity**: Severely impacted

---

## RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **URGENT**: Investigate if deleted data can be recovered from Replit infrastructure backups
2. **CRITICAL**: Implement automatic backup system
3. **HIGH**: Fix database migration system to prevent schema drift
4. **HIGH**: Add proper cascade rules to all foreign keys
5. **MEDIUM**: Implement data integrity monitoring

---

## CONTACT INFORMATION

The development team is available for any additional information or logs required to investigate these issues. The production system remains partially operational but is missing the majority of its critical business data.

**Note**: A rollback was considered but would undo critical security fixes that were successfully implemented, creating a difficult trade-off between data recovery and system security.
