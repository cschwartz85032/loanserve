Re: Confidential pre-litigation settlement offer regarding Cox Mobile device financing and Cox Business early-termination penalties; Citizens Pay credit reporting and TILA/FCRA issues

Rule 408 communication. Without prejudice to any claims or defenses.

To Counsel:

I write to offer a businesslike resolution of the disputes described in the enclosed draft Verified Complaint before filing. I am prepared to file in Maricopa County Superior Court if needed, but I prefer to resolve this efficiently.

Summary of key facts, with dates and objective records

July 15, 2024. A Cox agent solicited me to switch to Cox Mobile, representing two smartphones would be free and that any credit, if any, would be limited to routine monthly service charges. I did not knowingly apply for or execute device financing.

Cox transmitted my personal information to Citizens. A “Citizens Pay” device-financing account was opened without my informed consent and without Truth in Lending Act disclosures.

August 6–10, 2024. I discovered the account, immediately reported fraud to Cox, returned the unopened devices, and Cox reversed all device charges.

August 15, 2024. Despite a zero balance, Citizens reported the account as delinquent to consumer reporting agencies.

I disputed with Cox, Citizens, and the CRAs. Correction did not occur with reasonable reinvestigation. I experienced credit damage, reduced credit lines or increased rates, time loss, costs, and distress.

July 20–August 30, 2024. The same Cox agent referenced above represented that my Cox Business account could be transferred to residential service without penalties. Relying on that representation, I authorized the transfer. Cox terminated the business account on or about August 23, 2024, then attempted to impose early-termination penalties. A collection notice issued from General Revenue Corporation on or about August 30, 2024.

Legal theories pleaded in the draft complaint
Arizona Consumer Fraud Act, fraudulent and negligent misrepresentation, TILA, FCRA furnisher liability, identity theft under A.R.S. § 44-1691, defamation, negligence, unjust enrichment, breach of contract, declaratory and injunctive relief, and punitive damages. The enclosure details the allegations, jurisdiction, parties, and prayer for relief.

Proposed global settlement terms

Non-monetary relief
1.1 Written confirmation that the Citizens Pay account was unauthorized and is void.
1.2 Immediate deletion of all related tradelines and hard inquiries with Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion using ACDV/AUD workflows and direct-to-bureau communications. Provide bureau confirmation letters within 14 days.
1.3 Written confirmation that any Cox Business early-termination penalties are fully waived, all balances are zero, and all internal and third-party collections are recalled. Provide a zero-balance letter and instruct General Revenue Corporation to close the file.
1.4 Identify a single point of contact at each company who will confirm completion status in writing.
1.5 A 12-month bar on re-reporting or re-assigning the same debts absent new written consent from me.

Monetary relief
Rather than anchoring a number, I invite your written monetary proposal that makes me whole for actual harms and your statutory exposure. This should address:
• Actual credit harm and reputational injury arising from inaccurate reporting and failed reinvestigation.
• Out-of-pocket losses and documented time spent mitigating the harm.
• Exposure under TILA and FCRA, and related state-law claims pleaded in the draft complaint.
Please provide your proposal with supporting rationale within 10 days of this letter.

Process and verification
3.1 Within 7 days, please provide any evidence you believe shows my informed assent to device financing: signed application, e-signature logs with timestamps and IP metadata, call recordings, and screenshots of any disclosures shown prior to account opening.
3.2 Upon settlement execution and non-monetary performance, I will refrain from publicity and will take reasonable steps to reinforce bureau corrections if requested.
3.3 Mutual releases will be limited to the facts and time period described in the draft complaint. No non-disparagement beyond truthful regulatory or credit reporting communications.

Deadlines
Please confirm in writing by 5:00 p.m. Arizona time on Friday, September 19, 2025 that you accept the non-monetary framework and will submit a monetary proposal within 10 days. If you need brief additional time solely to route for signatures, acknowledge acceptance by the deadline and propose a short, specific signing date.

Evidence preservation
Please preserve all relevant ESI and paper records, including CRM notes, chat logs, call recordings, e-signature audit trails, data sent to or from Citizens, ACDV and AUD records, and communications with third-party collectors.

I am available to work with you on a concise settlement agreement that mirrors the steps above. You can reach me at 602-558-1833 or cschwartz@loanatik.com
