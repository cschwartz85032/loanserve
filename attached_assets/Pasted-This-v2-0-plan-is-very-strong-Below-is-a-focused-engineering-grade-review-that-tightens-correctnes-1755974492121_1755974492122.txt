This v2.0 plan is very strong. Below is a focused, engineering-grade review that tightens correctness, closes edge cases, and turns it into a spec your team can implement without guesswork.

I’ve kept it point-by-point. Where useful, I include exact DDL, invariants, and handler rules.

A. Lifecycle and settlement: tighten semantics

Pending vs settled
Keep “posted_pending_settlement” strictly for ledger entries that are not final. Create a companion settlement workflow per source:

ACH: probe windows by return code class, daily bank file reconciliation, settle only after window elapses or bank confirms.

Wires: settle on bank advice.

Checks/lockbox: settle on bank clear; handle NSF/stop payment returns.

Cards: two-step auth→capture; settle on capture success; chargebacks map to returned.

State transitions are monotonic and append-only
Never mutate past rows to “hide” history. Every reversal uses compensating entries and emits a distinct event. Store previous_state in the transition log to verify legitimate paths.

Per-loan serialization
Even with queue sharding, enforce a per-loan mutex in the processing step:

Option A: advisory lock on hashtext(loan_id) during allocation and ledger post.

Option B: optimistic SERIALIZABLE transaction with retry on serialization failures.
Choose one and document it.

B. Schema: add referential integrity, invariants, and performance structure

Your DDL is a good base. Extend it to enforce accounting and data-quality guarantees.

-- Domain tables (examples)
CREATE TABLE currency_codes(code CHAR(3) PRIMARY KEY);
INSERT INTO currency_codes(code) VALUES ('USD');

CREATE TABLE accounts_chart (
  account VARCHAR(50) PRIMARY KEY,      -- e.g. interest_income, principal, escrow_tax

);

-- CREATE TABLE loans(loan_id VARCHAR(50) PRIMARY KEY, ...);

Rationale

chk_one_sided prevents accidental double-sided lines.

FKs make distributed handlers safe; if a loan/investor is missing the transaction fails fast and DLQs.

Ownership sums must equal 100% at any effective date; enforce via a deferred trigger to allow batch updates.

C. Allocation engine: unambiguous rules, rounding, back-dating

Allocation order is configurable but deterministic
Keep your priority list. Add explicit flags to allow:

Escrow-only payments.

Hold partial payments in unapplied until a full installment is available.

Proportional application when policy requires.

Interest math
Use exact day count convention configured per product (e.g., Actual/365, 30/360). Back-dated payments recompute accrued interest to effective date; produce a delta entry that adjusts interest and principal precisely.

Rounding
Represent amounts in integer cents; for multi-line splits use largest remainder so sum(lines) == total. Document tie-break rule (e.g., prefer highest principal or highest investor position).

Payoff protection
If a payment is marked as payoff, validate against a payoff quote snapshot (good-through date, per-diem) and reject if short; excess routes to refund/unapplied.

D. Investor math and clawbacks: precision and transparency

Effective-dated ownership
Pick positions where effective_from ≤ payment.effective_date < coalesce(effective_to,'infinity').

Servicing fee
Calculate per program:

Strip as bps of UPB or fraction of collected interest first.

Post servicing fee lines to income; reduce distributable.

Waterfalls
Implement pro_rata and sequential now; leave hooks for hurdle structures. Keep calculations in integer cents end-to-end.

Clawbacks
On return, create negative distributions. Net against the investor’s payables first; if not possible, book an investor receivable and notify. Never silently re-debit external investor accounts without authorization.

E. Returns and reversals: full compensation playbook

Map ACH return codes to retryable vs permanent lists.

Reversal saga steps (all idempotent):

Reverse loan ledger (mirror lines).

Reverse escrow contributions; move any paid invoices to shortage.

Post negative distributions; schedule clawback netting.

Recompute late fees if grace now exceeded.

Notifications to borrower/investors; compliance event.

Everything wrapped with an outbox so events publish atomically with state.

F. Messaging topology: concrete bindings and DLQ policies

Use the topic namespace consistently. Examples (extend as needed):

Produced events:
payment.ach.received, payment.ach.validated, payment.ach.processed, payment.ach.settled, payment.ach.returned, payment.ach.reversed
distribution.calculated, distribution.posted, distribution.clawback
escrow.applied, escrow.reversed

Queues (quorum) and bindings:
payments.validation ← payment.*.received
payments.processing ← payment.*.validated
payments.posted ← payment.*.processed
payments.settlement ← payment.*.settlement.*
payments.returned ← payment.*.returned
payments.reversal ← payment.*.reversed.requested
payments.distribution← payment.*.settled
investor.posting ← distribution.calculated
investor.clawback ← distribution.clawback
escrow.apply ← payment.*.processed
escrow.reverse ← payment.*.reversed
payments.compliance ← payment.*.*
audit.events ← # (or stream sink)

DLQ policy
Every queue sets x-dead-letter-exchange = dlx.main, routing key ${queue}.dlq.
Add 3 retry tiers with increasing TTL (e.g., 30s, 5m, 30m) before parking-lot.
Functional validation failures do not retry; go straight to parking-lot with a human-readable error.

Ack discipline
Consumers ack after the DB commit and outbox write succeeds. Never ack on receipt.

G. Envelope and idempotency: lock it down

Your envelope is solid. Add these enforcement points:

message_id (ULID) unique per event.

idempotency_key per business operation (e.g., ACH trace) to prevent duplicates at the command boundary.

Per-consumer inbox table guarding handler re-entry:

CREATE TABLE inbox (
  consumer VARCHAR(100),
  message_id VARCHAR(26),
  processed_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
  PRIMARY KEY (consumer, message_id)
);


Outbox table to atomically publish events produced by the transaction. Publisher uses RabbitMQ confirms.

H. Security & compliance guardrails

PAN/PCI: do not store card PANs. Use tokens only; keep you out of SAQ-D where possible.

PII at rest: encrypt sensitive borrower data in DB (field-level or tablespace encryption).

Secrets: broker credentials in a secret manager; TLS everywhere.

Audit immutability: replicate audit.events into object storage with Object Lock (WORM). Keep index in DB for fast search.

I. Monitoring, SLOs, reconciliation

Metrics
Publish per stage: throughput, p95/p99 latency, ready/unacked, redelivery, DLQ depth, settlement overdue count, reversal backlog, idempotency drop count.

Dashboards

“Payment Flow” chord chart: counts by state.

“Settlement” panel: probes due vs overdue.

“Distribution” accuracy: sum(distributions) == distributable delta alerts.

Alarms

DLQ depth sustained.

Confirm latency spikes (publisher pressure).

Processing lag per queue.

Reconciliation variances > $0.01.

Daily reconciliations

Bank files vs payment_transactions totals.

Investor payables vs posted distributions.

Escrow balances vs escrow ledger.

J. Testing: add golden sets and invariants

Golden datasets for each source: real-world ACH/lockbox edge cases, large month-end batches.

Property tests: allocation and distribution always conserve value.

Idempotency tests: duplicate received events never double-post.

Chaos: kill consumers mid-transaction, ensure exactly-once effects hold (outbox/inbox patterns catch duplicates).

Soak: ≥24h at target throughput with synthetic bank files.

K. Performance guidance (initial dials)

Validation prefetch 64; processing 8–16; distribution 16–32. Tune via queue utilization and DB CPU.

DB pool per service 30–60; use prepared statements.

Partition ledger and transactions monthly when rows > 50M.

Use quorum queues for financial work; classic only where you need priority and accept trade-offs.

L. Operational runbooks (checklist excerpts)

Retry/DLQ: classify error, re-publish with next delay tier or park with reason code.

Reversal: one-pager with steps and who is paged.

Backfill: ingest old bank files with idempotency keys; run in a maintenance window with serialization enabled per loan.

Cutover: dual-write and shadow-consume for at least one full cycle; compare reconciliations before flipping.

M. Small but important fixes to v2.0 text

Add explicit time-zone policy. Use TIMESTAMPTZ everywhere and domain calendars for banking holidays; never rely on server local time.

Add payoff path and bankruptcy/charge-off guards at validation.

Document escrow-only and unapplied behaviors clearly so borrower statements match ledger.

Document exact day count conventions per loan program.

For “audit.events”, record both envelope and payload hash to detect tampering.
