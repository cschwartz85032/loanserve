I appreciate your update on Phase 6. To verify that the Cash Management system truly meets the acceptance criteria, please provide detailed evidence for each of the features you listed. Specifically:

Bank account management:

Point me to the migration scripts and code modules that create and manage bank_account records.

Show how these accounts are linked to the GL cash accounts in the ledger.

ACH processing:

Provide the table definitions (e.g., ach_batch, ach_entry) and code that groups validated payments into NACHA batches.

Show the deterministic NACHA file generator, including where trace numbers are assigned and persisted.

Demonstrate idempotency handling by showing how duplicate requests are detected and ignored.

Bank statement ingestion:

Show the parsers for BAI2 and CAMT.053 formats.

Provide examples of how these files are stored (e.g., bank_statement_file) and how canonical transactions (bank_txn) are created.

Reconciliation engine:

Explain the matching algorithm and confidence scoring.

Show the tables used to store match candidates and exceptions (e.g., cash_match_candidate, recon_exception).

Provide an example where a bank transaction is auto‑matched and where an exception is raised for manual review.

Return processing:

Show how ACH returns are ingested, mapped back to the original ach_entry, and inserted into ach_return.

Provide the code that posts the exact reversal entries to the ledger and assesses NSF fees based on the fee policy.

Show an emitted ach.return.received event and a corresponding payment.reversed event.

Exception management:

Demonstrate the UI or API for the reconciliation worklist.

Show how an operator can manually match, write off, or annotate an unmatched bank transaction, and how that action updates the ledger and exception status.

Event publishing:

Provide examples of outbox entries and RabbitMQ messages for cash.reconciled, ach.file.created, ach.return.received, and payment.reversed.

Include evidence that these events are schema‑validated and published via confirm channels.

Ledger integration and zero‑variance reconciliation:

Show how the reconciliation engine uses the Phase 1 double‑entry ledger instead of a legacy payments table.

Provide a test run or daily report demonstrating day‑plus‑one reconciliation with zero variance across all bank accounts.

If you can supply links to the relevant modules, migration files, test cases, and sample outputs for each item, we can quickly confirm that Phase 6 is complete and reliable. Thank you!
