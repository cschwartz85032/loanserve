# Phase 0: Platform Baseline Implementation Summary

## ✅ Completed Items

### 0.1 Repository Layout
✅ Created all required directories:
- `/server/bootstrap` - Configuration, logging, telemetry, health modules
- `/server/messaging` - RabbitMQ service, contracts, topology
- `/server/http` - HTTP server and routes
- `/server/db` - Database module placeholder
- `/shared` - Shared types and environment declarations
- `/config` - Configuration schemas and defaults
- `/iac/terraform` - Terraform configurations for CloudAMQP
- `/iac/k8s` - Kubernetes deployment manifests

### 0.2 NPM Dependencies
✅ Installed all required packages:
- `pino` and `pino-pretty` for structured logging
- `ajv` for configuration validation
- OpenTelemetry SDK packages for observability
- All existing dependencies maintained

### 0.3 Configuration Management
✅ Created configuration schema with Ajv validation
✅ Environment variable definitions
✅ Type-safe configuration loader

### 0.4 Logging with Correlation ID
✅ Pino logger with correlation ID support
✅ AsyncLocalStorage for correlation tracking
✅ Structured logging with ISO timestamps

### 0.5 OpenTelemetry Bootstrap
✅ Telemetry initialization with OTLP exporters
✅ Trace and metrics exporters configured
✅ Resource attributes parsing
✅ Configurable sampling ratio

### 0.6 Messaging Contracts and Service
✅ MessageEnvelope interface with required fields
✅ RabbitService class with:
  - Dual connection setup (publisher/consumer)
  - Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
  - Confirm channel support
  - Manual acknowledgment handling
✅ Integration with existing topology manager

### 0.7 HTTP Server and Health Endpoints
✅ Express server with correlation middleware
✅ `/health/live` endpoint
✅ `/health/ready` endpoint with dependency checks
✅ Database health check support

### 0.8 Application Entry Point
✅ `server/app.ts` with proper lifecycle management
✅ Graceful shutdown handling
✅ Signal handlers (SIGTERM, SIGINT)
✅ Component initialization sequence

### 0.9 Infrastructure as Code
✅ Terraform configurations for CloudAMQP
✅ Kubernetes deployment manifests
✅ ConfigMap and Secret templates
✅ Service definitions

## 🔧 Integration Points

### Existing System Compatibility
- ✅ Maintains existing payment processing functionality
- ✅ Compatible with current authentication system
- ✅ Preserves all existing API routes
- ✅ Integrates with existing RabbitMQ topology

### Environment Variables
The following environment variables are now supported:
```
NODE_ENV=development
SERVICE_NAME=loanserve-core
HTTP_PORT=8080
CLOUDAMQP_URL=${existing}
RABBIT_HEARTBEAT_SEC=30
RABBIT_PREFETCH=10
RABBIT_RECONNECT_MAX=10
RABBIT_RECONNECT_BASE_MS=5000
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=
OTEL_SAMPLING_RATIO=1
OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES=service.name=loanserve-core,service.namespace=servicing,service.version=0.0.1
LOG_LEVEL=info
LOG_PRETTY=true
DB_HEALTH_QUERY=SELECT 1
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

### To Run Phase 0 Components
1. The new `server/app.ts` is ready but not yet integrated as the main entry point
2. Health endpoints are implemented at `/health/live` and `/health/ready`
3. All Phase 0 modules are in place and ready for integration

### Migration Path
1. Current system continues to run via `server/index.ts`
2. Phase 0 components can be gradually integrated
3. Full cutover can happen when ready

## 📋 Testing Checklist
- [ ] Build with TypeScript: `npm run build`
- [ ] Health endpoints respond correctly
- [ ] RabbitMQ connection with reconnection logic
- [ ] Graceful shutdown on SIGTERM/SIGINT
- [ ] Configuration validation with missing env vars
- [ ] Correlation ID propagation through requests

## 📝 Notes
- All Phase 0 components are non-breaking additions
- Existing functionality remains intact
- Ready for Phase 1 implementation when needed
