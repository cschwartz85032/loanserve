# Production Authentication Fix Summary

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Session Cookie Configuration ✅
**Problem:** Session cookies were not being set properly in HTTPS production environments.
**Solution:** Updated `server/auth.ts` to:
- Automatically set `secure: true` when NODE_ENV=production
- Use `sameSite: 'lax'` for production (allows redirects)
- Validate SESSION_SECRET is set in production

### 2. RBAC Schema Alignment ✅
**Problem:** Concern about schema mismatch between database and code.
**Status:** Verified that:
- `shared/schema.ts` correctly defines `rolePermissions` with `roleId` and `permissionId`
- Database migration 0009 matches this structure
- `resolveUserPermissions` correctly joins these tables

### 3. Session User ID Resolution ✅
**Problem:** Middleware not finding user ID from passport session.
**Solution:** Updated `loadUserPolicy` middleware to check:
1. `req.user.id` (passport populated)
2. `req.session.passport.user` (passport session)
3. `req.session.userId` (custom session)

### 4. Error Handling ✅
**Problem:** Silent failures when loading user policies resulted in 401 errors.
**Solution:** Changed middleware to:
- Return 500 error with clear message when policy loading fails
- Log detailed session debugging information
- Prevent requests from continuing without proper authentication

## Deployment Checklist

### Before Deployment
1. **Set Environment Variables:**
   ```bash
   NODE_ENV=production
   SESSION_SECRET=<64-character-secure-random-string>
   DATABASE_URL=<your-production-database-url>
   ```

2. **Generate Secure SESSION_SECRET:**
   ```bash
   openssl rand -base64 64
   ```

3. **Verify Database Schema:**
   - Ensure migrations have been run
   - Confirm sessions table has unique constraint on `sid`

### After Deployment
1. **Test Authentication:**
   - Clear browser cookies
   - Login with admin credentials
   - Verify session cookie is set with `Secure` flag
   - Check that API calls include the cookie

2. **Monitor Logs for:**
   - "SESSION_SECRET must be set in production" (should not appear)
   - "Failed to load user policy" (indicates RBAC issues)
   - "User logged in successfully" (confirms auth working)

3. **Verify Cookie in Browser DevTools:**
   - Name: `connect.sid`
   - Secure: ✓ (true)
   - HttpOnly: ✓ (true)
   - SameSite: Lax

## Troubleshooting

If authentication still fails:

1. **Check Server Logs:**
   ```bash
   # Look for session data debug output
   grep "Session data:" logs
   ```

2. **Verify SESSION_SECRET:**
   - Must be the same across all instances
   - Must not change between deployments
   - Must be different from development

3. **Database Connection:**
   - Ensure production database is accessible
   - Check that sessions are being created in the table
   - Verify role_permissions table has correct data

4. **Clear and Retry:**
   - Clear all browser cookies for the domain
   - Try incognito/private browsing mode
   - Test with a different browser

## Key Files Modified
- `server/auth.ts` - Session configuration
- `server/auth/middleware.ts` - User policy loading
- `DEPLOYMENT.md` - Complete deployment guide
- `.env.example` - Environment variable template

## Next Steps
1. Deploy these changes to production
2. Set required environment variables
3. Test login functionality
4. Monitor for any authentication errors

The authentication system is now production-ready with proper HTTPS support and robust error handling.
